        Rudolph needs to escape from this cyberspace maze by reaching the flag.
        He starts where indicated and can move North/East/South/West to points
        along the same layer, or he can Ascend/Descend between layers (as shown
        by the dashed lines).
      </p>
      <p>
        He can only go in the direction of the arrows. If he touches a key, then
        ALL the gold arrows will swap direction. What is his shortest route to
        get to the flag â€“ and can you describe it using one 7-letter word?
      </p>
